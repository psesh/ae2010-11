equation: \\(\\rho \\frac{Du}{Dt} = -\\nabla p + \\rho g + \\mu \\nabla^2 u\\) under the assumption of no gravitational or viscous effects we have \\(\\rho \\frac{Du}{Dt} = -\\nabla p\\), using the

\\(f=f_1\\frac{a^2}{A^2}\\) (12) and \\(\\phi = \\frac{\\phi_1}{A}\\) (13) where \\(a^2 = \\gamma \\frac{p_0}{\\rho_0}\\) and is the speed of sound.

simplify these for the case where \\(y_1 &gt;&gt;\\) to get [15a], [16a], and [17a]:\n\\[\n\\large\n\\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_0} = \\frac{\\gamma+1}{\\gamma-1}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\large\n\\frac{U^2}{a^2} =

\\(y=R^{-3}f_1\\) using these equations [16a] becomes [16b]:\n\\[\n\\large\n\\frac{A^2R^{-3}f_1}{A^2f} = \\frac{\\gamma + 1}{2\\gamma}R^{-3}f_1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\large\nf = \\frac{2\\gamma}{\\gamma + 1}\n\\]\nLastly, for [17a] we can use that \\(u=R^{-3/2}A\\phi\\) and \\(U=\\frac{dR}{dt}=AR^{-3/2}\\) to get [17b]:\n\\[\n\\large\n\\frac{AR^{-3/2}\\phi}{AR^{-3/2}} = \\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\large\n\\phi = \\frac{2}{\\gamma+1}\n\\]\nNote: In Taylor’s paper [16a] is different:  However, this does not derive from equation 16 and does not simplify to [16b] so I’m not sure what he did but the end result of [16b] is the same\nBy using ([15b], [16b], [17b]) and using that \\(\\gamma=1.4\\) we can get values for \\(f\\), \\(\\phi\\), and \\(\\psi\\) at \\(\\eta=1\\):\n\n\nCode\n# define values at eta=1\nf_0 = 7/6\nphi_0 = 5/6\npsi_0 = 6\ng = 1.4\n\n\nUsing [14], [7a], and  [9a] we can define functions to calculation \\(f'\\), \\(\\phi'\\), and

\\(\\phi\\), and \\(\\psi\\) we can calcuate the change at very small increments\n\n\nCode\netas = np.linspace(1,0.5, 100)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# step by step calculation \nfs = []\nphis = []\npsis =

= \\gamma \\phi' + \\frac{2\\gamma \\phi}{\\eta} - 3\n\\]\nIf the left-hand side is ignored then the solution is \\(\\phi = \\frac{\\eta}{\\gamma}\\) [21] this linear relationship follows what is calculated by the step process however it starts to break away at high values of \\(\\eta\\) meaning there is a correction factor of the form \\(\\alpha\\eta^n\\) where \\(\\alpha\\) and n are constants [22]\n\\[\n\\large\n\\phi = \\frac{\\eta}{\\gamma} + \\alpha\\eta^n\n\\]\nThese constants can be found using [16b] and [17b], firstly by using [17b] and plugging that value in for \\(\\phi\\) at \\(\\eta=1\\) we get [23]:\n\\[\n\\large\n\\frac{2}{\\gamma +1} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} + \\alpha (1)^n \\longrightarrow \\alpha = \\frac{\\gamma -1}{\\gamma(\\gamma +1)}\n\\]\nNext, we can use ([15b], [16b], [17b]) to find the true value of \\(f'\\) at \\(\\eta=1\\) getting that \\(f' = \\frac{2\\gamma^2 +7\\gamma-3}{\\gamma-1}\\), next we can take the derivative of [22] to get \\(\\phi' = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} +\\alpha n \\eta^{n-1}\\) then plug this value into [20] and set them equal in order to calculate n [24]:\n\\[\n\\large\nn = \\frac{7\\gamma-1}{\\gamma^2 -1}\n\\]\nThen we can use [22] to solve for \\(f\\) and \\(\\psi\\), firstly plugging [22] into [20] we get [25]:\n\\[\n\\large\n\\frac{f'}{f} = \\frac{(n+2)\\alpha\\gamma^2\\eta^{n-2}}{\\gamma-1-\\gamma\\alpha\\eta^{n-1}}\n\\]\nTaking the derivative and solving for the derivation constant using the value of \\(f\\) at \\(\\eta=1\\) we get that [26]:\n\\[\n\\large\nln(f) = ln\\left(\\frac{2\\gamma}{\\gamma+1}\\right) - \\frac{2\\gamma^2+7\\gamma-3}{7-\\gamma}ln\\left(\\frac{\\gamma+1-\\eta^{n-1})}{\\gamma}\\right)\n\\]\nNext we can use [22] and its derivative to solve for \\(\\psi\\) by using  [9a]:\n\\[\n\\large\n\\frac{\\psi'}{\\psi} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\gamma} + \\alpha n \\eta^{n-1} +

heat\nKinetic energy in integral form using spherical coordinates is \\(KE=4\\pi\\int_0^Rfrac{1}{2}\\rho u^2r^2dr\\)\nIn terms of the variables \\(\\phi\\), \\(\\psi\\), \\(f\\), and \\(\\eta\\) we can write this as:\n\\[\n\\large\n2\\pi\\int_0^11 \\rho_0\\psi A^2R^{-3}\\phi^2 R^2\\eta^2 Rd\\eta = 2\\pi A^2\\rho_0\\int_0^1 \\psi \\phi^2 \\eta^2 d\\eta\n\\]\nHeat energy in integral form using spherical coordinates is \\(HE=4\\pi\\int_0^R\\frac{pr^2}{\\gamma-1}dr\\)\nIn terms of the variables \\(\\phi\\), \\(\\psi\\), \\(f\\), and \\(\\eta\\) we can write this as:\n\\[\n\\large\n\\frac{4\\pi}{\\gamma-1} \\int_0^1 p_0 \\frac{A^2}{a^2}fR^{-3} R^2\\eta^2 Rd\\eta = \\frac{4\\pi A^2 \\rho_0}{\\gamma(\\gamma-1)} \\int_0^1 f \\eta^2 d\\eta\n\\]\nTherefore the

(Assume that the fluid in the wind tunnel is air, and that it is a perfect gas with \\(R=287 J/kg \\; K\\), \\(\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}c}_{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p} = {\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}1006} \\; {\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}J/(kg \\cdot K)}\\) and \\(\\gamma = 1.4\\)).\n\nUsing your own definition of the geometry, i.e., you can define the boundaries using linear or polynomial, or other parametric curves, develop a code that lets you visualize the Mach number, static pressure, stagnation pressure, static temperature, and stagnation temperature contours of the flow through the wind tunnel. Clarify any assumptions you are making with regards to this. \\(\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.400002,0.400116,0.998569}[30]}\\)\n\nExtra credit: Only when you are done with (a, b, c, d) should you attempt this. Re-visit your answer for d, but this time consider a flow that has friction.\nYou might find this link to be particularly useful.\n\n\nSolution\n\nThe solutions below are strictly for parts (a-c). For (d) and (e) your submissions will be checked based on whether (i) the code does work, and (ii) if the Mach number and other flow quantities are correctly plotted.\n\nIf the nozzle is designed for \\({\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}M}={\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}2.2}\\) at the end of the divergence, we have\n\n\\[\n\\large\n\\require{color}\n\\frac{\\dot{m} \\sqrt{{\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}c}_{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p} {\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}T_0}}}{A_{\\ast}^{nozzle} {\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_0}} = 1.281 \\; \\; \\; (Table \\; lookup \\; for \\; {\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}M}={\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}1})\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\large\n\\require{color}\n\\frac{\\dot{m} \\sqrt{{\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}c}_{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p} {\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}T_0}}}{A_{ws} {\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_0}} = 0.639\\; \\; \\; (Table \\; lookup \\; for \\; {\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}M}={\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}2.2})\n\\]\nTherefore the area of the throat in the nozzle is given by:\n\\[\n\\large\n\\require{color}\nA_{\\ast}^{nozzle} = \\frac{0.639}{1.281} \\times 2.5 = 1.247 \\; m^2.\n\\]\n\nThe diffuser must be designed so that it does not choke under the worst possible starting conditions, i.e., when the strong possible shock exists upstream. With \\({\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}M}={\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}2.2}\\) in the working section, we have \\({\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{0,\\textrm{downstream of shock}}} / {\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{0,\\textrm{upstream of shock}}} = 0.628\\).\n\nThen we have\n\\[\n\\large\n\\require{color}\n\\frac{\\dot{m} \\sqrt{{\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}c}_{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p} {\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}T_0}}}{A_{ws} {\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{0s}}} \\leq 1.281\n\\]\nNow recognizing that the non-dimensional flow capacity is greatest when the Mach number is closest to unity, and if we assume that the non-dimensional flow capacity at the diffuser throat is near unity, we have the following inequality:\n\\[\n\\large\n\\require{color}\n\\frac{A_{\\ast}^{diffuser}}{A_{\\ast}^{nozzle}} \\geq \\frac{{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{0,\\textrm{upstream of shock}}}}{{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{0,\\textrm{downstream of shock}}}} \\Rightarrow A_{\\ast}^{diffuser} \\geq \\frac{1.247}{0.628} = 1.9856 \\; m^2.\n\\]\n\nThe key here is to leverage the isentropic flow relations. First, following the solution above we know that \\({\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{0,\\textrm{downstream of shock}}}= {\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}62.8 \\; kPa}\\). As the problem is a closed-circuit wind tunnel, this implies that flow leaving the diffuser goes back to the compressor, serving as its inlet, and consequently the high pressure air output of the compressor serves as the inlet to the wind tunnel. Thus we can write\n\n\\[\n\\large\n\\require{color}\n\\frac{{\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}T_{0,\\textrm{compressor exit}}}}{{\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}T_{0,\\textrm{compressor inlet}}} } = \\left( \\frac{{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{0, \\textrm{compressor exit}}}}{{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{0,\\textrm{compressor inlet}}}}\\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma - 1}{\\gamma}}\n\\]\nwhere\n\n\\(\\mathsf{{\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}T_{0,\\textrm{compressor inlet}}} = {\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}290 K}}\\) owing to the fact that the stagnation temperature does not change from the wind tunnel inlet to the wind tunnel exit (and consequently the compressor inlet).\n\\(\\mathsf{{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{0,\\textrm{compressor exit}}} = {\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}100 kPa}}\\) as the compressor exit stagnation pressure is the same as the wind tunnel inlet stagnation pressure.\n\\(\\mathsf{{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{0,\\textrm{compressor inlet}}} = {\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}62.8 kPa}}\\) as the flow is isentropic downstream of the shock to the compressor inlet.\n\nFollowing the above we can calculate the stagnation temperature of the fluid leaving the compressor, i.e.,\n\\[\n\\large\n\\require{color}\n\\frac{{\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}T_{0,\\textrm{compressor exit}}}}{{\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}290}} = \\left( \\frac{{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}100}}{{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}62.8}} \\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma - 1}{\\gamma}} \\; \\; \\Rightarrow \\; \\; {\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}T_{0,\\textrm{compressor exit}}} = {\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}331.22 \\; K}\n\\]\nNote that the statement, the air is cooled between the compressors and the inlet to the working section implies that there is a cooling system for the air leaving the compressor. Thus, the work done by the compressor must not include any cooling effects, hence we have the relations above.\nThe work done by the compressor may be written as the change in enthalpies.\n\\[\n\\large\n\\require{color}\n{\\color[rgb]{0.562040,0.190215,0.568721}w} = {\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}c}_{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p} \\left( {\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}T_{0,\\textrm{compressor exit}}} - {\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}T_{0,\\textrm{compressor inlet}}} \\right) = {\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}1.006} \\times \\left( {\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}331.22} - {\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}290} \\right) = {\\color[rgb]{0.562040,0.190215,0.568721}41.46 \\; kJ / kg}\n\\]\nNow, in the working section we know the flow capacity is given by:\n\\[\n\\large\n\\require{color}\n\\frac{\\dot{m} \\sqrt{{\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}c}_{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p} T_0}}{A_{ws} {\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{0}}} = 0.639 \\Rightarrow \\dot{m} = \\frac{0.639 \\times 2.5 m^2 \\times {\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}100} \\;  \\times {\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}10^3 \\; Pa}}{\\sqrt{{\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}1006} \\; J/kg \\; K\\times {\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}290 \\; K}}} = 295.76 \\; kg/s\n\\]\nThus, the power with a shock in the working section is\n\\[\n\\large\n\\require{color}\nPower = 295.76 \\; kg/s \\times  {\\color[rgb]{0.562040,0.190215,0.568721}41.46 \\; kJ/kg} \\times 10^{-3} \\; MJ/kJ = 12.22 \\; MW\n\\]\nAs mentioned, students can get either full credit for the above, or for the solution below. Full credit implies that atleast one power was correctly computed. Students will receive extra if both solutions are correct.\nPlease note that this problem can also be solved assuming that the wind tunnel is run with the shock in the diffuser. This would be the scenario when the wind tunnel has been running for a while. In such a case we use \\(A_{\\ast}^{diffuser} = 1.9856 \\; m^2\\). Thus, the non-dimensional flow capacity becomes\n\\[\n\\large\n\\require{color}\n\\frac{\\dot{m}\\sqrt{c_p T_0}}{A_{\\ast}^{nozzle} {\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_0}} \\times \\frac{A_{\\ast}^{nozzle}}{A_{\\ast}^{diffuser}} = 1.281 \\times \\frac{1.247}{1.9856} = 0.804\n\\]\nNote that from the tables, this implies that we have a Mach number of \\({\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}1.930}\\) before the diffuser where the shock occurs. At this Mach number the stagnation pressure drop across the shock is \\(0.7535\\).\nFrom this, we can work out the stagnation temperature rise across the compressor, i.e.,\n\\[\n\\large\n\\require{color}\n\\frac{{\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}T_{0,\\textrm{compressor exit}}}}{{\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}290}} = \\left( \\frac{{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}100}}{{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}75.35}} \\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma - 1}{\\gamma}} \\; \\; \\Rightarrow \\; \\; {\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}T_{0,\\textrm{compressor exit}}} = {\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}314.42\\; K}\n\\]\nAs before, we can use this to work out the mass flow rate\n\\[\n\\large\n\\require{color}\n\\dot{m} = 0.804 \\times \\frac{A_{\\ast}^{diffuser} \\times {\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{0}} }{\\sqrt{{\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}c}_{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p}{\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}T_0}}} = \\frac{3.171 \\times 1.9856 \\times {\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}100 \\times 10^3} }{\\sqrt{{\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}1006} \\times {\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}290}}} = 295.56 \\; kg/s\n\\]\nFinally, we can work out the power output by the compressor, i.e.,\n\\[\n\\large\n\\require{color}\nPower = 295.56 \\; kg /s \\times {\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}1006} \\times \\left( {\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}314.42} - {\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}290} \\right) = 7.26 \\; MW\n\\]\nIn practice this latter solution yields the minimum power."

A negative pressure gradient is considered to be favorable because it allows the flow to move in the direction of initial velocity. However, when the pressure gradient is greater than zero it is considered to be adverse. If the flow were Couette+Poiseuille and the pressure gradient were adverse the flow near the bottom unoving plate would be pushed oppoiste the direction of the moving top plate.

However, the helium entering at this point originally came from upstream in the main where the velocities are low, and it may be shown that the value of \\(\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}h_i}\\) used above is correct."

This is because the helium expands into the empty bottle in an unrestrained manner.\n- The large temperature rise \\(\\require{color}\\left({\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}201 \\; K}\\right)\\) comes from the work done by the gas in the main. This reduces the density and thereby restricts the amount of helium entering. Since the bottle has a fixed volume, a reduction in density results in a reduction in mass that can enter the bottle.   - In practice there would probably be some heat transfer, so if the valve were left open long enough, the helium would cool back down to \\(\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}300\\; K}\\) and more of it would enter the bottle. However, thermodynamics cannot inform us how long this would take; we need tools from heat transfer to understand that."

The one shown above is for supersonic flows, i.e., where the Mach number is greater than unity. A similar one exists for subsonic flows, however it has far fewer columns (see Problem 2) as it does not include any shock relations.\nThere are a few points to note regarding the columns of such a table. The first column is the Mach number, but just because it is supersonic doesn’t imply that there will be a shock. When there is no shock, the flow is still considered isentropic, and thus one can use the isentropic flow relations to work out static-to-stagnation ratios. This corresponds to the columns 2 to 4 (inclusive). The column with \\(M_s\\) and the four columns thereafter correspond to a scenario where there is a normal shock; the subscript \\(s\\) denotes shock. To clarify, \\(M_s\\) is the post-shock Mach number, \\(P_{0s} / P_{0}\\) is the ratio of the stagnation pressure post-shock vs the stagnation pressure pre-shock, and so on. The values we have computed above using the normal shock relations are highlighted and shown within rectangles for clarity."

The one shown above is for supersonic flows, i.e., where the Mach number is greater than unity. A similar one exists for subsonic flows, however it has far fewer columns (see Problem 2) as it does not include any shock relations.\nThere are a few points to note regarding the columns of such a table. The first column is the Mach number, but just because it is supersonic doesn’t imply that there will be a shock. When there is no shock, the flow is still considered isentropic, and thus one can use the isentropic flow relations to work out static-to-stagnation ratios. This corresponds to the columns 2 to 4 (inclusive). The column with \\(M_s\\) and the four columns thereafter correspond to a scenario where there is a normal shock; the subscript \\(s\\) denotes shock. To clarify, \\(M_s\\) is the post-shock Mach number, \\(P_{0s} / P_{0}\\) is the ratio of the stagnation pressure post-shock vs the stagnation pressure pre-shock, and so on. The values we have computed above using the normal shock relations are highlighted and shown within rectangles for clarity."

However, assuming there is no shock, the stagnation pressure will stay the same; the stagnation temperature will also stay the same (even if there is a shock). So will the massflow rate (conservation) and \\(\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}c}_{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p}\\). Thus, this column is useful for understanding the relationship between the area and the Mach number. From the highlighted row in the table, we can write\n\\[\n\\large\n\\require{color}\n\\frac{\\dot{m} \\sqrt{{\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}c}_{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p} {\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}T_0} }}{A_{\\star} {\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_0}} = 1.281\n\\]\nwhere \\(A_{\\star}\\) denotes the area where the flow chokes.

To work out exactly what this value is, we must interpolate; from the block of code below the corresponding exit Mach number is found to be \\(\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}0.407}\\).\nNext, to work out the strength of the shock, i.e., its Mach number, we recognize that across the shock there will be a drop in the stagnation pressure. The stagnation pressure downstream of the shock will be the same stagnation pressure at the exit.\n\\[\n\\large\n\\require{color}\n\\frac{{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{0,exit} }}{{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{0} }} = \\frac{\\dot{m} \\sqrt{{\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}c}_{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p} {\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}T_0} }}{A_{\\star} {\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{0}}} \\times \\frac{A_{\\star}}{A_{exit}} \\times \\frac{A_{exit} {\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{0,exit}}}{\\dot{m} \\sqrt{{\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}c}_{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p} {\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}T_0} }} = 1.281 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{0.817} = 0.784\n\\]\nNote that the stagnation pressure at the throat is the same as the stagnation pressure at the inlet. The value of \\(0.817\\) arises by interpolating between the two highlighted flow capacities (stagnation pressure in the denominator).\nFinally, we can use this value of the stagnation pressure ratio to work out the Mach number of the shock, using the table below.\n\nStudying the last column, we note that the Mach number of the shock has to lie between \\(\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}1.86}\\) and \\(\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}1.87}\\).

To relate this equation to the pressure gradient equation we just solved for we must take the derivative of Bernoulli’s equation so that it involves the pressure gradient.

The same value of the non-dimensional flow capacity can be obtained at a \\(\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}M} = \\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}0.420}\\), for which \\(4 c_f L_{max}/D \\approx 1.9744\\).\nWith supersonic flow throughout the nozzle divergence, there will be a shock at the nozzle end. This will yield a low subsonic Mach number a the beginning of the pipe. A \\(\\mathsf{M=1.88}\\) gives a \\(\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}M_s}={\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}0.5996}\\) post-shock. Another table look-up (subsonic this time) for the latter Mach number yields \\(4c_fL_{max}/D = 0.4908\\).\n\nA quick table look-up for Mach numbers of \\(\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}1.88}\\) and \\(\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}0.60}\\) reveal that \\(\\require{color}F/\\dot{m}\\sqrt{{\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}c}_{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p} {\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}T_0}} = 1.0940\\). As the stagnation temperature, and massflow rate is the same, the force must be equivalent too. From the above it is clear that case (i) and case (iii) have the same pressure force on flow in the divergence. Therefore, the two cases must have the same friction force. Note that the subsonic flow has a lower average \\(\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.918231,0.469102,0.038229}\\rho} {\\color[rgb]{0.059472,0.501943,0.998465}v}^2\\), hence lower average wall stress, hence a longer pipe is possible.\nExtra comment: It may be useful to re-think of this problem in the following light; see the figure below."

From the tables, the Mach number in front of the shock is \\({\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}1.84}\\).\nWhen the Mach number is \\(\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}1.84}\\), the non-dimensional flow capacity is given by\n\\[\n\\require{color}\n\\large\n\\frac{\\dot{m}\\sqrt{{\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}c}_{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p} {\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}T_0}}}{A {\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{0}}} = 0.863\n\\]\nwhere the \\(\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_0}\\) is the same as at the throat.

Even in flows with a very low viscosity the viscous forces will never be negligible near a wall and will cause a boundary layer to form thus the field contours would differ along \\(y\\) and can lead to the potential for flow separation. Friction also causes a loss of heat meaning the flow would no longer be adiabatic and causes a drop in enthalpy, therefore reducing efficency as well as the exit Mach number.\n\n\nCode\n# create contour maps of the nozzle\nfig = go.Figure()\n\nfig.add_contour(z=[M_values, M_values], x=x, contours_coloring = 'heatmap', line_width = 0, colorscale = 'deep',\n                reversescale = True, colorbar=dict(title='Mach Number', titleside='right'))\nfig.add_contour(z=[p0_values, p0_values], x=x, contours_coloring ='heatmap', line_width = 0, colorscale = 'Teal', \n                visible = False, colorbar=dict(title='Stagnation Pressure (kPa)', titleside='right'))\nfig.add_contour(z=[p_values, p_values], x=x, contours_coloring = 'heatmap', line_width = 0, colorscale = 'viridis', \n                visible = False, colorbar=dict(title='Static Pressure (kPa)', titleside='right'))\nfig.add_contour(z=[T_values, T_values], x=x, contours_coloring = 'heatmap', line_width = 0, colorscale = 'blackbody', \n                reversescale = True, visible = False, colorbar=dict(title='Static Temperature (K)', titleside='right'))\n\nfig.add_scatter(x=x, y=alpha+0.15, line_color = 'white')\nfig.add_scatter(x=x, y=x-x+0.3, fill='tonexty', fillcolor='white', line_color='white')\nfig.add_scatter(x=x, y=beta+0.15, fill='tozeroy', fillcolor='white', line_color='white')\n\nfig.update_layout(showlegend=False, updatemenus=[dict(active=0, buttons = [dict(label='Mach Number', method='update', args=\n                  [{'visible':[True, False, False, False, True, True, True]}]), dict(label='Stagnation Pressure', \n                  method='update', args=[{'visible':[False, True, False, False, True, True,True]}]), dict(label=\n                  'Static Pressure', method='update', args=[{'visible':[False, False, True, False, True, True, True]}]),\n                  dict(label='Static Temperature', method='update', args=[{'visible':[False, False, False, True, True, True,\n                  True]}])], y=1.2, x=1.1)])\n\nfig.update_yaxes(range=[0, 0.3], showticklabels = False)\nfig.update_xaxes(title='x position')\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing Flow Movement \nFrom the velocity function we can visualize how fluid would move through the nozzle.

    "section": "Curve fitting with least squares",
    "text": "Curve fitting with least squares\nTo fit a curve through these points, we first need to decide what basis we should use. Do we want sines or cosines, fractions, exponentials, or just a quadratic polynomial? For now let us opt for a quadratic polynomial, as this results in a linear problem. The first thing we shall do is generate a matrix; lets call it \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). This matrix has the following form:\n\\[\n\\large\n\\mathbf{A}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\mathbf{1} & \\mathbf{x} & \\mathbf{x}^{2}\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\n\n\nCode\nA = lambda x : np.hstack([np.ones((x.shape[0],1)), x, x**2 ])\nprint(A(x))\n\n\n[[1.   0.1  0.01]\n [1.   0.2  0.04]\n [1.   0.3  0.09]]\n\n\nNow what we will do is to solve\n\\[\n\\large\n\\mathbf{Au} = \\mathbf{y}\n\\]\nfor the unknown coefficients \\(\\mathbf{u}\\). Another way of thinking about this equation is that we would like to minimize the distance between\n\\[\n\\large\n\\mathbf{Au} - \\mathbf{y}\n\\]\nMathematically, this distance is the standard Cartesian distance, i.e., square root sum of the squares. This is then written as\n\\[\n\\large\n\\underset{\\mathbf{u}}{minimize} \\; \\; || \\mathbf{Au} - \\mathbf{y} ||_{2}^{2}\n\\]\nWhile you will learn about many more such distance metrics in time, for the \\(L_2\\) norm distance above, we can use the least squares approach that solves the normal equations under the hood. In python this is given by:\n\n\nCode\nu = np.linalg.lstsq(A(x), y, rcond=None)[0]\nprint(u)\n\n\n[[ 1. ]\n [-2.5]\n [ 3. ]]\n\n\nThis tells us what \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is. Note that the first entry corresponds to the intercept; the second corresponds to the coefficient of the linear term, and the third is the quadratic coefficient. So we have figured out what the underlying function \\(f\\) is! Yay! To plot this curve across a finer grid of points, we first generate a finer grid of points and call it \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\\)\n\n\nCode\nhat_x = np.linspace(0.1, 0.4, 50).reshape(50, 1)\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,3))\nax = plt.gca()\nplt.plot(hat_x, hat_x*0,  'o')\nplt.xlabel('x')\nax.get_yaxis().set_visible(False)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we evaluate the matrix \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}\\) at this finer set of points, i.e.,\n\\[\n\\large\n\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\mathbf{1} & \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} & \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}^{2}\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nand multiply it by the obtained coefficients, i.e., \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} \\mathbf{u}\\).\n\n\nCode\nhat_y = A(hat_x) @ u # the @ is the dot operator, i.e., the dot product.\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,3)) \nplt.plot(x, y, 'o')\nplt.plot(hat_x, hat_y, 'r--')\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('y')\nplt.show()"

This is just for the first shock.\n\nFor the second shock we are given the wedge angle to be \\(\\theta = 10^{\\circ}\\) and \\(\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}M_2} = {\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}1.7011}\\). Once again consulting the tables (see below) we arrive at \\(\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}M_b} = {\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}1.347}\\). Note that this corresponds to the supersonic solution and not the subsonic one.\n\nThe third and final shock has a wedge angle given by \\(\\theta = 22^{\\circ} - 14^{\\circ} = 8^{\\circ}\\). At this wedge angle, we once again take the first (or the weaker) solution, which yields \\(\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}M_2} = {\\color[rgb]{0.041732,0.352132,0.699576}0.95}\\).\n\n\nNext, to work out the relationship between \\(h\\) and \\(l\\) we note that\n\n\\[\n\\large\n\\require{color}\ntan \\left( {\\color[rgb]{0.131302,0.999697,0.023594}\\beta} \\right) = \\frac{h}{l} \\Rightarrow tan \\left({\\color[rgb]{0.131302,0.999697,0.023594}38.702^{\\circ}}\\right) = \\frac{h}{l} \\Rightarrow l = 1.25 h\n\\]\n\nTo work out the pressure losses, we make use of the stagnation pressure ratios:\n\n\\[\n\\large\n\\require{color}\n\\frac{{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{02}}}{{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{01}}} = \\frac{{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{02}}}{{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{0b}}} \\frac{{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{0b}}}{{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{0a}}} \\frac{{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{0a}}}{{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_{01}}}  = 0.97093 \\times 0.9875 \\times 0.98812 = 0.9473\n\\]"

    "text": "Problem 2\nConsider the following qualitative queries:\n\nWhy does the pressure decrease towards the center of a cyclone?\nAn often used demonstration for the Bernoulli equation is to hold a sheet of paper between both hands in front of (and slightly below) your mouth so that it drops away from you face. As you blow over the upper surface of the paper it should rise. Why is this not a demonstration of Bernoulli’s equation?\nWhy does the paper rise? What is the name of this effect?\nGive some examples of the Magnus effect and explain how it works.\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nCurved streamlines are indicative of a pressure gradient, i.e., with higher pressure lying away from the center of curvature. This is why the pressure towards the center of a cyclone is lower than the pressure that lies outward.\nIt is incorrect to assume that the air in the jet has the same Bernoulli constant as the surrounding ambient air. In fact, assuming the static pressure of the jet leaving the mouth is the same as the ambient pressure, then there is a difference of \\(\\require{color}\\{\\color[rgb]{0.918231,0.469102,0.038229}rho} {\\color[rgb]{0.059472,0.501943,0.998465}v}^2 / 2\\) between the two.\nThe paper lifts owing to the Coanda effect.\nThe Magnus effect is observed on rotating cylinders or spheres. A pressure difference across a rotating body is formed which leads to a normal force, generating lift (depending on the direction of rotation). Some examples include spinning golf and baseballs."

Also note that if the shaft work is set to zero, this yields teh familiar Bernoulli’s equation for incompressible, steady and inviscid (and thus reversible) flow."

Within the compressor the air undergoes a reversible polytropic process, \\({\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p}{\\color[rgb]{0.918231,0.469102,0.038229}\\nu}^{n} = constant\\), where \\({\\color[rgb]{0.918231,0.469102,0.038229}\\nu}\\) is the specific volume and \\(n\\) is a constant. Assume air behaves as a perfect gas and neglect changes in kinetic and potential energy between the inlet and outlet.\n\n\n\nFluid flows through a duct of height \\(h\\) as shown in the figure below. Part of the upstream section of this duct is divided into two separate ducts of height \\({\\color[rgb]{0.599997,0.600015,0.600005}h}\\) and \\({\\color[rgb]{0.599997,0.600015,0.600005}3h}\\) respectively. At station \\({\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}1}\\), far upstream, the velocity and pressure are uniform in each duct. In the larger duct, the velocity is \\({\\color[rgb]{0.059472,0.501943,0.998465}v_1}\\) and the pressure is \\({\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_1}\\), and in the smaller duct the velocity is \\({\\color[rgb]{0.059472,0.501943,0.998465}9v_1}\\), but the pressure is the same.\nAt some distance from the exit of the smaller duct, a flat plate of height \\({\\color[rgb]{0.599997,0.600015,0.600005}h}\\) is mounted on the floor, perpendicular to the flow. Fluid from the two upstream ducts mixes turbulently and passes through the gap between this flat plate and the top of the duct. At station \\({\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}2}\\), just upstream of the gap, the pressure is uniform across the whole height of the duct and the velocity \\({\\color[rgb]{0.059472,0.501943,0.998465}v_2}\\) is uniform across the gap. At station \\({\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}3}\\), far downstream, the velocity \\({\\color[rgb]{0.059472,0.501943,0.998465}v_3}\\) and pressure \\({\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_3}\\) are both uniform over the whole duct height. The fluid throughout has a uniform density of \\({\\color[rgb]{0.918231,0.469102,0.038229}\\rho}\\), the flow is incompressible and friction forces may be ignored. The duct has unit width into the page.\n\n\n\nPlease clarify whether the entire statement is true or false. You are not required to justify your answers for statements.\n\n\n\nWithin the compressor of a modern turbofan engine, the stagnation temperature and stagnation pressure within the main gas path are found to be \\({\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}500 \\; K}\\) and \\({\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}13 \\; atmospheres}\\). The static pressure here is measured to be \\({\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}10 \\; atmospheres}\\). What is the velocity of the gas? You may assume the heat capacity ratio, \\(\\gamma=1.4\\) and a specific gas constant value of \\(R=287 \\; J/(K \\cdot kg)\\). Hint: Assume the flow is isentropic. \\({\\color[rgb]{0.028509,0.250925,0.501969}[8]}\\)\n{\nThe solution to this problem can be obtained either via the tables or via a direct calculation. First, note that the relationship between the static and stagnation pressures permits us to work out the Mach number, i.e.,\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{p_{0}}{p} & = \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\left( \\gamma - 1 \\right)}{2} M^2 \\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma - 1}} \\\\\n\\frac{13}{10} & = \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\left( 0.4 \\right)}{2} M^2 \\right)^{\\frac{1.4}{0.4}}\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nwhich leads to \\(M = 0.624\\). To work out the velocity, we need to determine the speed of sound, \\(a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}\\) where \\(T\\) is the static temperature (this step is very important–using the stagnation temperature here is wrong!). Using the isentropic flow relations, we have\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{p_0}{p} = \\frac{13}{10}  & = \\left( \\frac{T_0}{T} \\right)^{\\gamma / (\\gamma - 1 )} \\\\\n& = \\left( \\frac{500}{T} \\right)^{1.4 / 0.4}\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nwhich implies that \\(T=463.89 \\; K\\). This yields \\(a = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\times 463.89} = 431.73 \\; m/s\\). The velocity is then given by \\(v = M a = 0.624 \\times 431.73 = 269.4 \\; m/s\\). }"

Within the compressor the air undergoes a reversible polytropic process, \\({\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p}{\\color[rgb]{0.918231,0.469102,0.038229}\\nu}^{n} = constant\\), where \\({\\color[rgb]{0.918231,0.469102,0.038229}\\nu}\\) is the specific volume and \\(n\\) is a constant. Assume air behaves as a perfect gas and neglect changes in kinetic and potential energy between the inlet and outlet.\n\n\n\nFluid flows through a duct of height \\(h\\) as shown in the figure below. Part of the upstream section of this duct is divided into two separate ducts of height \\({\\color[rgb]{0.599997,0.600015,0.600005}h}\\) and \\({\\color[rgb]{0.599997,0.600015,0.600005}3h}\\) respectively. At station \\({\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}1}\\), far upstream, the velocity and pressure are uniform in each duct. In the larger duct, the velocity is \\({\\color[rgb]{0.059472,0.501943,0.998465}v_1}\\) and the pressure is \\({\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_1}\\), and in the smaller duct the velocity is \\({\\color[rgb]{0.059472,0.501943,0.998465}9v_1}\\), but the pressure is the same.\nAt some distance from the exit of the smaller duct, a flat plate of height \\({\\color[rgb]{0.599997,0.600015,0.600005}h}\\) is mounted on the floor, perpendicular to the flow. Fluid from the two upstream ducts mixes turbulently and passes through the gap between this flat plate and the top of the duct. At station \\({\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}2}\\), just upstream of the gap, the pressure is uniform across the whole height of the duct and the velocity \\({\\color[rgb]{0.059472,0.501943,0.998465}v_2}\\) is uniform across the gap. At station \\({\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}3}\\), far downstream, the velocity \\({\\color[rgb]{0.059472,0.501943,0.998465}v_3}\\) and pressure \\({\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p_3}\\) are both uniform over the whole duct height. The fluid throughout has a uniform density of \\({\\color[rgb]{0.918231,0.469102,0.038229}\\rho}\\), the flow is incompressible and friction forces may be ignored. The duct has unit width into the page.\n\n\n\nPlease clarify whether the entire statement is true or false. You are not required to justify your answers for statements.\n\n\n\nWithin the compressor of a modern turbofan engine, the stagnation temperature and stagnation pressure within the main gas path are found to be \\({\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}500 \\; K}\\) and \\({\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}13 \\; atmospheres}\\). The static pressure here is measured to be \\({\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}10 \\; atmospheres}\\). What is the velocity of the gas? You may assume the heat capacity ratio, \\(\\gamma=1.4\\) and a specific gas constant value of \\(R=287 \\; J/(K \\cdot kg)\\). Hint: Assume the flow is isentropic. \\({\\color[rgb]{0.028509,0.250925,0.501969}[8]}\\)\n{\nThe solution to this problem can be obtained either via the tables or via a direct calculation. First, note that the relationship between the static and stagnation pressures permits us to work out the Mach number, i.e.,\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{p_{0}}{p} & = \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\left( \\gamma - 1 \\right)}{2} M^2 \\right)^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma - 1}} \\\\\n\\frac{13}{10} & = \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\left( 0.4 \\right)}{2} M^2 \\right)^{\\frac{1.4}{0.4}}\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nwhich leads to \\(M = 0.624\\). To work out the velocity, we need to determine the speed of sound, \\(a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}\\) where \\(T\\) is the static temperature (this step is very important–using the stagnation temperature here is wrong!). Using the isentropic flow relations, we have\n\\[\\begin{equation*}\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{p_0}{p} = \\frac{13}{10}  & = \\left( \\frac{T_0}{T} \\right)^{\\gamma / (\\gamma - 1 )} \\\\\n& = \\left( \\frac{500}{T} \\right)^{1.4 / 0.4}\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation*}\\]\nwhich implies that \\(T=463.89 \\; K\\). This yields \\(a = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\times 463.89} = 431.73 \\; m/s\\). The velocity is then given by \\(v = M a = 0.624 \\times 431.73 = 269.4 \\; m/s\\). }"
