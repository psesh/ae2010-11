    "#### Instructions\n",
    "Please do not attempt to copy or discuss the contents of this paper with any of your classmates during the course of this paper. Any such attempt, or even the action of glancing over someone else’s work will be viewed as a violation of Georgia Tech’s Honor Code, and this will result in a zero-point grade. Additionally, you are not permitted to use any electronic device during the course of this paper, aside from a standard calculator. You are permitted to use the restrooms, however, prior to leaving the lecture theatre, you are required to leave your cellular device(s) with the instructor. You may collect these once you return. As discussed, you are permitted to use two sides of a single 8.5” x 11” sheet of paper for formulas, notes, or derivations that you may find useful. There is no restriction on what your notes may comprise. Please do not turn in any scratch paper, and ensure your submitted answers do indeed answer the question that is being asked. Carefully read each question as the ask may be slightly different from questions you have practiced before. The numerical value after each question, e.g., ${\\color[rgb]{0.028509,0.250925,0.501969}[5]}$ denotes the number of marks assigned to that question. Finally, please write down all your answers on this provided sheet, along with your derivations and calculations. "
