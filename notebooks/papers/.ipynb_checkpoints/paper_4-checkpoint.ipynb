    "#### Instructions and comments: \n",
    "This is a take-home exam, and should take you less than 115 minutes to complete. While you may discuss questions with other students in this course, the work you submit must be your own. You are welcome to all resources that have been made available on the course website; you will not need any other resources. You are not permitted to post / ask questions on any external online forum; you are also not permitted to speak to any tutor about these questions. Any violation of the above will result in a zero-point grade. Should you have any questions or require any clarifications, please email me. Please do not turn in any scratch paper, and ensure your submitted answers do indeed answer the question that is being asked. Carefully read each question as the ask may be slightly different from questions you have practiced before. The numerical value after each question, e.g., ${\\color[rgb]{0.028509,0.250925,0.501969}[5]}$ denotes the number of marks assigned to that question. Finally, please either (i) write down all your answers on a print out of this set, or (ii) write the answers on a separate sheets---the choice is yours. Submit this to my office (MK421A) anytime before the deadline. If I am not in, please slide your solution under the door. No late solutions will be accepted. I wish you all the very best of luck, and I just want to say that it has been a pleasure to be your instructor for this course. "
