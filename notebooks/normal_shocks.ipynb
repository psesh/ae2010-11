    "In this notebook we will study the effect of a shock on a choked converging diverging nozzle. After the flow reaches the throat the flow will transfer to supersonic, meaning the flow is travelling faster than the speed of sound and there can be no more *communication* between the inlet and exit as it can only move as fast as the speed of sound. This means that fluids that normally react to changes in pressure and temperature can no longer do so. For sound waves at supersonic speeds the source is travelling faster than the waves can propogate (at the speed of sound) and the waves produced by the source will constructvely interfere and form areas of high pressure that lead to a shock. As the pressure outside the nozzle (back pressure) is decreased the shock will move closer to the exit, until the back pressure is lower than the pressure at the throat, at which point a shock will no longer occur within the nozzle and the flow will either be underexpanded, exit pressure is higher than back pressure, or overexpanded, exit pressure is lower than back pressure. The diagram below shows the different cases that can occur in the nozzle, with case C being what we will study\n",

    "Next we can make contour plots of the fields within the nozzle. As there is no $y$ variation these plots will be uniform in the $y$-direction, however, when we get to topics such as boundary layers this will change and will no longer be uniform. In reality, isentropic flow is an idealized process as is a frictionless duct. Even in flows with a very low viscosity the viscous forces will never be negligible near a wall and will cause a boundary layer to form thus the field contours would differ along $y$ and can lead to the potential for flow separation. Friction also causes a loss of heat meaning the flow would no longer be adiabatic and causes a drop in enthalpy, therefore reducing efficency as well as the exit Mach number."
