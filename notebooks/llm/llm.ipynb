    "A total of 16 Q&As that span incompressible flows, thermodynamics and compressible flows:\n",

    "- 7 Q&As must pose and answer a numerical question (requiring code).\n",

    "*Extra credit:* Additional Q&As that require generating a plot. Some examples include:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Correct solution 3/5\n",
    "- Creativity in question 1/5 (e.g., “What is the first law” is not as creative as “How and why does one distinguish between shaft and flow work in the first law?”\n",
    "- Comprehensiveness (while being concise) in the solution, e.g., stating all the relevant assumptions, accounting for any possible edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "All code-based questions will be graded on an 8-point scale with the following breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 5 points following the conceptual question rubric.\n",
    "- 4 points for code that runs as intended. Please ensure that you only use ``python`` with ``numpy`` and ``matplotlib`` libraries, and you avoid overly long / efficient code.  \n",

In other words, a heat engine must exchange heat with a low temperature sink as well as a high temperature source to keep operating.
