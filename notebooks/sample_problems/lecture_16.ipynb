    "A gas-powered refrigerator works by taking in heat from a heat exchanger at ${\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}500^{\\circ} \\; C}$ and from a cold space at ${\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}-10^{\\circ} \\; C}$, while rejecting heat to the environment at ${\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}35^{\\circ} \\; C}$. The refrigerator is a cyclic device, and there is no work input or output. Use the Clausius inequality to find the minimum rate at which heat must be supplied by the heat exchanger in order to extract heat at a rate of ${\\color[rgb]{0.334690,0.296180,0.998454}1 \\; kW}$ from the cold space.
