    "A quantity of dry air is slowly compressed in a cylinder by means of a piston, until its volume is halved. The initial pressure and volume are $\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}1 \\; bar \\; \\;  (10^5\\;  Pa)}$ and $\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.079785,0.618358,0.483717}1 \\;liter}$ respectively, and during the compression the pressure varies inversely with the volume. Sketch the process on a $\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p}-{\\color[rgb]{0.079785,0.618358,0.483717}V}$ diagram and calculate the work transfer.
