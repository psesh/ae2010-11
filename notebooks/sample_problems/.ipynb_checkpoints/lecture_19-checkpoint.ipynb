    "Combustion gases enter the turbine of a jet engine at $\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}15.0 \\; bar}$ and $\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}1250 \\; K}$ with a velocity of $\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.059472,0.501943,0.998465}50 \\; m/s}$. At the exit, the pressure, temperature, and velocity are $\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}3.0 \\; bar}$, $\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.164799,0.878862,0.723179}850 \\; K}$ and $\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.059472,0.501943,0.998465}100 \\; m/s}$ respectively. The exit area is given to be $0.6 \\; m^2$. Calculate the mass flow rate and the power output from the turbine. Assume perfect gas relations with $R = 288 J/\\left(kg \\cdot K \\right)$ and $\\require{color}{\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}c}_{\\color[rgb]{0.315209,0.728565,0.037706}p} = {\\color[rgb]{0.986252,0.007236,0.027423}1200 \\; J/\\left(kg \\cdot K \\right)}$. \n",
